 * \section intro_sec SmartCalc v1.0 Documentation
 *
 * This is an extended version of the usual calculator made in C programming
 * language using structured programming. In addition to basic arithmetic
 * operations such as add/subtract and multiply/divide, it supports calculating
 * arithmetic expressions by following the order, as well as some mathematical
 * functions (sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.). Besides calculating expressions,
 * it supports the use of the x variable and the graphing of the corresponding
 * function. SmartCalc also has Fixed Deposit Calculator and Credit Calculator
 * regimes.
 *
 * \subsection step1 Arithmetic operators:
 *
 * - Brackets    (a + b)
 * - Addition    a + b
 * - Subtraction    a - b
 * - Multiplication    a * b
 * - Division    a / b
 * - Power    a ^ b
 * - Modulus    a mod b
 * - Unary plus    +a
 * - Unary minus    -a
 *
 * \subsection step2 Functions:
 *
 * - Computes cosine    cos(x)
 * - Computes sine    sin(x)
 * - Computes tangent    tan(x)
 * - Computes arc cosine    acos(x)
 * - Computes arc sine    asin(x)
 * - Computes arc tangent    atan(x)
 * - Computes square root    sqrt(x)
 * - Computes natural logarithm    ln(x)
 * - Computes common logarithm    log(x)
